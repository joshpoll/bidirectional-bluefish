# Bidirectional Bluefish

Bidirectional editor for Bluefish components. How hard could it really be??

This repo was initialized using architectural notes from ChatGPT.

# Random Notes

I can now manipulate two circles individually.

The next thing to try out is align and/or spacing components via a combination of direct
manipulation (typically drop-down menu or similar) and editing code directly.
One question is going to be how to resolve edits once the align/space is persistent. We want to
conservatively extend GUIs so you should probably be able to select individual elements and/or the
group and then do something with it. But you should also be able to make larger scale edits using
code or some special propagation mode or something.
